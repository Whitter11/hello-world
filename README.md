# hello-world
This is my short description....:)
I'm stuck at home with this whole pandemic shenanigans. I decided to start remotely learning along with my double-trouble doppelgangers. I've always been fascinated with programming and the underlying works of computer operating systems! Here I am, on GitHub... writing a mini bio as part of my first learning course. I'm not fascinating just yet.... stay tuned.
